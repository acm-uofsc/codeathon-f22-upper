The IQ of tons of famous people from history have been posted on a number line made by the history museum. The exhibit is a huge hit and you've been put in charge of it!

There are lots of IQ listed on the exhibit, and many visitors are asking you to tell them how they stack up against all the famous people. For each visitor, tell them how many people on that list that they are smarter than, and also tell them separately how many people from that list they are as smart as or smarter than.

Given a visitor's IQ, tell them how many people on the list they are smarter than, then how many people they are as smart as or smarter than (the list only contains famous people from history, so it does not change after each visitor asks you)
